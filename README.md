Surrealist is a simple to use Browser and Desktop based query playground and database explorer for [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/). You can connect to any SurrealDB server and execute queries in a graphical interface, including table & variable auto completion, syntax highlighting, and much more. Switch to the explorer view to browse database tables, edit record contents, and traverse graph relationships. Use the designer view to create or modify your database schema, and manage logins and scopes with the authentication view.

## How to use
You can [read our documentation](https://surrealist.starlane.studio/) for information on how to use Surrealist.

## Web App
You can use Surrealist by visiting https://surrealist.app/

While the web app provides a convenient and easy way to use Surrealist, the desktop app offers additional features such as an integrated database runner and offline support.

## Desktop App
You can download the latest version of Surrealist Desktop from our [Releases](https://github.com/StarlaneStudios/Surrealist/releases) page. This version provides significantly more functionality over the web app, so it is considered the recommended way to use Surrealist.

### Running on MacOS
Running Surrealist on MacOS is more complicated than on its Windows and Linux counterparts because our application is not signed. To run Surrealist on MacOS, please do the following:
- Navigate to your desired release (v1.6.0 and newer)
- Download the `surrealist-<version>-darwin.dmg` release file
- Open the executable
- When prompted, drag the Surrealist application into the "Applications" directory
- Navigate to your Applications directory
- Right-click on the Surrealist application and cick on open (Note: It is important to use right-click because for some reason left clicking to open does not work the first two times you run Surrealist)
- You will receive a prompt that says "Surrealist cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified." Click on cancel
- Right-click on the Surrealist application and click on open again. This time you should receive a different prompt with an "Open" option. Click on open
- Surrealist should now launch, and you should now be able to launch Surrealist without issue from the Launchpad.

If the steps for either of these MacOS processes do not work, please do not hesitate to open an issue.

## Features

### Local database
You can start a local database directly from the application by pressing the start button in the top right. Doing so will start up a SurrealDB instance using the credentials and port entered for the current tab.

You can choose whether the local database is stored in memory or stored on disk on the Settings screen.

This functionality is currently only available in the desktop app.

### Query view
Use the Query View to execute queries against your database. You can define variables in the Variables panel and use them in your queries, and browse the results in the Results panel.

Executed queries are saved to the Query History or can be manually saved to the Favorites panel to quickly access previous queries.

### Explorer view
The Explorer View is used to browse your database and inspect individual records. When you select a table in the left panel, the table contents will be displayed in the Record Explorer. You can click on a record id to open the Record Inspector, in which you can edit the record contents and traverse graph relationships.

### Designer view
The Designer View is a powerful tool you can use to define and manage your database schemas. You can create tables & edges, modify the database schema, and visualize the database tables in a graph view.

### Authentication view
Use the Authentication View to manage access to the database by creating namespace logins, database logins, or scopes.

## Contributing
We welcome any issues and PRs submitted to Surrealist. Since we currently work on multiple other projects and our time is limited, we value any community help in supporting a rich future for Surrealist.

## Disclaimer
- The latest release always attempts to be up-to-date with the latest SurrealDB beta. No attempt is made to keep Surrealist compatible with the latest nightly builds.
- Connections to remote servers may require a HTTPS connection. You can easily configure SSL for your server using tools like Letsencrypt and nginx.
- This project is maintained entirely free of charge and in my spare time. I will make a best attempt at supporting as many features and workflows as possible, however I do not have the resources to cater to every use case.

## Development
This project is built using [Tauri](https://tauri.app) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

### Requirements
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Nodejs LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) (npm i -g pnpm)

Additionally, on ubuntu you will need to install the following packages: \
`apt install libjavascriptcoregtk-4.0-dev libsoup2.4-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev`

### Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `npm run tauri:dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes.

### Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `npm run tauri:build`.
