# Surrealist Contribution Guide
Welcome to the development of Surrealist! ðŸ˜„ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽŠ

Thanks for considering being a contributor to the Surrealist project. We decided to start this project in order to aid development of our other projects while using [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/). Since there were no other viable graphical query clients at the time, we built Surrealist with a focus on simplicity. While other clients may decide to provide a full database management experience, Surrealist was explicitly created to aid with writing queries and viewing their results. Our goal is for Surrealist to help you develop your SurrealDB powered application easier and faster.

Before partaking in development on Surrealist we do ask you to read through our contribution guidelines.

## Reporting Issues
* The issue list of this repo is **exclusively** for Bug Reports and Feature Requests.
* Bug reproductions should be as **concise** as possible.
* **Search** for your issue, it _may_ have been answered.
* See if the error is **reproduceable** with the latest version.
* **Never** comment "+1" or "me too!" on issues without leaving additional information, use the :+1: button in the top right instead.
* **Always be sure to take out any private or sensitive information**, especially when taking screenshots or sharing your config

## Pull Requests
* We ask you use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for your commit messages as to keep these consistent and concise.
  * Primarily use the `feat`, `fix`, `change`, `refactor`, and `chore` types, only deviate when necessary.
* Always work on a feature branch. You should follow the convention `feat/branch-name`, e.g. `feat/tab-renaming` (See [The beginner's guide to contributing to a GitHub project](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/))
* Use a descriptive title no more than 64 characters long.
* For changes and feature requests, please include an example of what you are trying to solve and an example of the markup. It is preferred that you create an issue first however, as that will allow the team to review your proposal before you start. 
* Please reference the issue # that the PR resolves, something like `Fixes #1234` or `Resolves #6458` (See [closing issues using keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/))
* Releases will be drafted in release branches following the convention `release/version`, e.g. `release/1.2.3`. Critical bug fixes should be merged directly into release branches, which will be merged back into main once the release is completed.
